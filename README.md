#Newsquid Test
Welcome to the Newsquid applicant test repository. In this repository you will
find two assignment folders, in each folder you will find a README.md that
describes the task at hand and some code to get you started.

When you have completed the assignments, commit your code locally to this git
repository and email an archive to <mailto:dev+applicant@newsquid.com>

Good luck, have fun.
