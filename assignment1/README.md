#Assignment 1
In this assignment you need to create a simple todo list application.
You are given a REST web service that has the following features:

- You can create a todo entry.
- You can update a todo entry.
- You can list all current todo entries.

A todo entry consists of an id, a title and a content field.

You are expected to create a very simple web application that allows a user to
view, create and update the todo entries, you are free to decide exactly how
this interaction is done.

A dummy API can be found at:   
If you find the API lacking in features, suggest improvements in a file called:
Improvements.md. You are not expected to implement these improvements.

You are expected to create the application as a JavaScript (or any language
that compiles to JavaScript) SPA using any libraries you choose.

We don't expect you to implement a full polished application no need for fancy
styling, when you have the basic features move on to the next assignment.
