#Assignment 1
In this assignment you need to create a simple todo-list web application.
You are given a REST web service that provides the following features:

- You can create a todo entry. [POST localhost:3000/todos]
- You can update a todo entry. [PUT localhost:3000/todos]
- You can list all current todo entries. [GET localhost:3000/todos]

A todo entry consists of an id, a title and a content field.

You are expected to create a very simple web application that allows a user to
view, create and update the todo entries, you are free to decide exactly how
this interaction is done.

The dummy API can be found in the /assignment1/backend folder. You will have to compile
and run it.
If you find the API lacking in features, you may suggest improvements in a file
called: Improvements.md. You are *not* expected to implement these improvements.

You are expected to create the application as a JavaScript (or any language
that compiles to JavaScript) SPA using any libraries or frameworks you choose.

You are *not* expected to do any backend work for this assignment.

We don't expect you to implement a fully polished application no, need for fancy
styling, when you have the basic functionality, you should move on to the next assignment.
