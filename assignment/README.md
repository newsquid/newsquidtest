#Assignment 2
In this assignment, you need to implement a change in the dummy API.
In /assignment2/backend you will find a REST web service, which implements a
simple in-memory datastore, simulating a relational database.

The service currently has a naive implementation of a comment system for a
a simple "todo-list" service .
You are expected to change the current implementation of comments, so that it
becomes possible to comment on comments, as well as on todo-objects.
You may order/arrange the comments returned by the API in any way you find
meaningful, though a comment explaining your choice will be considered a plus.

You are required to continue work in the existing Go implementation, but may make
any alterations you would like to it.

We suspect the only file you need to work on is
/assignment2/backend/api/comment.go, but you may alter or add files as you see
fit.

You are *not* expected to do any frontend work for this assignment.
